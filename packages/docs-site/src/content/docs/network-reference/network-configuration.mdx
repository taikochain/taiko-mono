## Cooldown Window, Proving Window and Bonds

This segment lists the cooldown windows and proving windows for every tier of proof in the Taiko protocol.

The cooldown window describes how long after the proof has been provided that the block is verified.

The proving window describes how long a prover has to provide a proof for a block after they have been assigned the block (i.e. a block has been proposed with them as the assigned prover).

You can find all the corresponding values below in the [deployed TierProviderBase contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x394E30d83d020469a1F8b16E89D7fD5FdB1935b0#code#F3#L1)!
