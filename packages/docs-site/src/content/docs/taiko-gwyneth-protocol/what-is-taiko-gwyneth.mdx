Based rollups are arguably the **most effective, decentralized, and Ethereum-aligned** way of running a rollup. By delegating the sequencing job to L1, a based rollup **inherits** the L1 decentralization, simplicity, and liveness, among other benefits.

**But what if you could amplify the benefits of a based rollup by adding out-of-the-box, native Ethereum L1 dapp scaling (sharding) to it?**

## Introducing Taiko Gwyneth

Taiko Gwyneth is a **horizontal Ethereum scaling solution** ([as opposed to vertical](/taiko-alethia-protocol/protocol-design/inception-layers)), combining based sequencing, real-time proving, and booster functionality. Gwyneth creates a **uniform execution environment** that scales Ethereum while solving liquidity fragmentation across multiple rollups.

### Why Taiko Gwyneth?

- **Ethereum-equivalent:** Each Gwyneth L2 functions like Ethereum, maintaining compatibility with existing dApps and tooling.
- **Scalable:** Developers can launch new rollups in the Gwyneth network as needed, increasing capacity without disrupting existing applications.
- **Seamless UX:** Users experience L1 and L2s as a unified system, retaining the same addresses across chains.
- **Synchronous composability:** Contracts on different Gwyneth L2s interact atomically via cross-chain `DELEGATECALL`.
- **Decentralized:** Built on a network of L2s that inherit Ethereum’s decentralization without reliance on centralized sequencers.
- **Secure execution:** Preconfirmations and real-time multi-proving ensure reliable execution and prevent MEV attacks.
- **Based Preconfirmations:** Transactions gain near-instant inclusion guarantees through preconfirmers.

### Key Concepts in Taiko Gwyneth

- **Based Booster Rollups:** L2s that inherit L1 state and function as execution shards of Ethereum.
- **Synchronous Composability:** Contracts on different Gwyneth L2s interact atomically via cross-chain calls.
- **Real-Time Multi-Prover System:** L2 state proofs are submitted in real-time for immediate verification.
- **Based Preconfirmations:** Transactions receive fast execution guarantees, significantly improving UX.

## How Taiko Gwyneth Works

### **Synchronous Composability and L2 ↔ L2 Calls**

Gwyneth introduces a new **XCALLOPTIONS** precompile that enables seamless cross-rollup execution.

<Code code='
XCALLOPTIONS(version: uint16, chainID: uint, sandbox: bool, txOrigin: address,
msgSender: address, blockHash: bytes32, proof: bytes)
 'lang="solidity" title="XCALLOPTIONS Context" />

- **Cross-rollup transactions:** The precompile allows contracts to specify the target chain for the next `CALL`, enabling direct state access across rollups.
- **Proof system:** Execution proofs ensure correctness when modifying states across chains.
- **State updates:** Each rollup maintains its own execution state but verifies interactions with other L2s through Merkle proofs.

### **Booster Functionality and L1 Scaling**

- **Unified L1 State:** Any Gwyneth L2 can read and interact with Ethereum’s L1 contracts without extra bridging logic.
- **Low-cost Execution:** Transactions use L2 gas fees while still accessing L1, reducing costs for users and developers.
- **Optimized Data Availability:** L2s post only necessary state deltas to L1, reducing congestion and storage costs.

### **Real-Time Proving and Based Preconfirmations**

To maintain high throughput, Taiko Gwyneth leverages **real-time proving** with multiple proof types:

- **TEE-Based Provers:** Fast hardware-based proofs using SGX, AMD SEV, and Nitro enclaves.
- **AVS Provers:** Distributed attestation systems that ensure correctness via economic incentives.
- **ZK Proofs (Future Integration):** While real-time ZK proving is not feasible today, Gwyneth is designed to integrate them as they mature.

Preconfirmations enhance UX by allowing transactions to be executed and confirmed near-instantly before final L1 settlement.

## Conclusion

Taiko Gwyneth is designed to scale Ethereum efficiently while preserving its security, decentralization, and user experience. With booster rollups, real-time proving, and preconfirmations, it enables synchronous execution across multiple L2s, creating a **seamless and scalable Ethereum-native rollup ecosystem**.
