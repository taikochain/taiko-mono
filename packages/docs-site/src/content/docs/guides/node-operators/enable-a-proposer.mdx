import { Aside, Card, CardGrid, Steps} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisites

- You are already running a Taiko node [with Docker](/guides/node-operators/run-a-taiko-node-with-docker) or [from source](/guides/node-operators/build-a-taiko-node-from-source).
- You have [set up a prover](/guides/node-operators/enable-a-prover) or [configured a ProverSet](/guides/node-operators/deploy-a-proverset) with a third-party partner.

{/*## Using `stn`

1. Install [stn](https://github.com/d1onys1us/stn) if you haven't already.
2. Execute `stn config proposer` in your terminal and walk through the steps.*/}

## Using simple-taiko-node

<Aside>
These are the bare minimum required settings along with a functional Taiko node to run a proposer, feel free to customize the rest of the variables in the `.env` file as you see fit!
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. First, you will need to [set up a prover](/guides/node-operators/enable-a-prover). Follow the guide, and note down the contract address for your `ProverSet` contract before continuing here.

2. Set the contract address in the `PROVER_SET` env variable.

3. Next, set the `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` to an L1 account's private key which will send the Propose Block transactions.

4. Then, set the `L2_SUGGESTED_FEE_RECIPIENT` to an L2 account's public key that will receive the fee.

5. Finally set `ENABLE_PROPOSER` to `true` in simple-taiko-node `.env`.

6. Set `COMPOSE_PROFILES=proposer` or add proposer to the list.

7. Now that the proposer is configured properly, you can run it with `docker compose up -d`!
