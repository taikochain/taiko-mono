## **Bonding Mechanisms in Taiko Alethia**

Bonding is a fundamental mechanism in the **proving and verification process** of Taiko Alethia. Different types of bonds ensure that **provers, contesters, and the network remain accountable** for their commitments.

### **Liveness Bond**
- A bond posted by the **initially assigned block prover** to guarantee that they will **submit the first proof** within the required proving window.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the assigned prover remains active and submits the initial proof within the allocated time.
- **Lifecycle**:
  1. The **L2 block proposer** submits a block via `proposeBlock` on **Ethereum L1**.
  2. The assigned prover locks a **Liveness Bond** to signal commitment.
  3. If the prover submits the proof within the **proving window**, the bond is refunded.
  4. If the proof is not submitted within the proving window, **another prover can step in**, but they must provide a new **Validity Bond**.

### **Validity Bond**
- A bond submitted by the prover at the time of **proving a block** (`proveBlock` transaction). This bond guarantees that the prover stands by the correctness of their proof.
- **Purpose**: Protects the network from **fraudulent or incorrect proofs** by ensuring provers have **economic skin in the game**.
- **Lifecycle**:
  1. A prover submits a **validity proof** for a block.
  2. The **Validity Bond** is locked in the contract.
  3. If the proof is verified and uncontested, the bond is **returned to the prover**.
  4. If the proof is contested and **found incorrect**, the bond is **slashed**.

:::note
**If a new prover submits a proof after the initial proving window**, they must post the **full validity bond** amount, regardless of whether the previous prover had posted a Liveness Bond.

### **Contest Bond**
- A bond submitted by a **contester** who believes an **already proven block** contains **an invalid proof** and should be escalated to a **higher-tier proof system** for validation.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that contesters only challenge proofs when they have strong evidence, preventing spam or frivolous disputes.
- **Lifecycle**:
  1. A prover submits a proof for a block.
  2. A **contester submits a Contest Bond** if they suspect the proof is invalid.
  3. The challenge escalates to a **higher-tier prover** for verification.
  4. If the **higher-tier proof** is valid, the **contester forfeits** their bond.
  5. If the **higher-tier proof is invalid**, the original prover's **Validity Bond is slashed**, and the contester **receives a portion** of the slashed bond.

## **Summary of Bonding Relationships**

| Bond Type        | Submitted By        | When Is It Locked?      | When Is It Returned? | When Is It Forfeited? |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Liveness Bond** | Assigned Block Prover | Upon block assignment (`proposeBlock` transaction) | When the block is proved within the proving window | If proof is not submitted within the proving window |
| **Validity Bond** | Prover (any) | Upon proof submission (`proveBlock` transaction) | If the proof is uncontested and verified | If the proof is invalid and contested successfully |
| **Contest Bond** | Contester | Upon submitting a dispute against an existing proof | If the contested proof is found invalid | If the contested proof is verified as correct |

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Liveness Bond** ensures that the initial prover submits their proof on time.
2. **Validity Bond** guarantees that a submitted proof is correct and withstands scrutiny.
3. **Contest Bond** prevents frivolous challenges by ensuring contesters have an economic stake in their disputes.
