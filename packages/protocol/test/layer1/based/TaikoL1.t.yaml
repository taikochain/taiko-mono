MultisigTest:
  - given: a new TaikoL1 with 10 slots for blocks and sync internval as 5
    then:
      - it: should initialize the genesis block
      - it: should initialize the first transition
      - it: should finalize the genesis block
      - it: the total number of block should be 1
      - it: get the genesis block should not revert
      - it: get the block 1 should revert indicating block not found
      - when: 10 blocks are proposed individually with different timestamp in different L1 blocks
        then:
          - it: propose another block will revert indicating no slot is available
          - when: all 10 blocks are proved and verified
            then:
              - it: should not revert
              - it: the last verified block id should be 10
              - it: the last synced block id should be 5
              - it: the last synced stateroot should be the one from block 5
              - it: the last synced timestamp should be the timestamp when block 5 is proposed
              - it: the total number of block should be 11
              - it: lastProposedIn should be the L1 block number when the last block is proposed
              - it: lastProposedAt should be the timestamp when the last block is proposed
              - when: the block 11 is proposed
                then:
                  - it: should not revert
                  - it: the last verified block id should be 10
                  - it: the last synced block id should be 5
                  - it: the last synced stateroot should be the one from block 5
                  - it: the last synced timestamp should be the timestamp when block 5 is proposed
                  - it: the total number of block should be 12
                  - it: lastProposedIn should be the L1 block number when the last block is proposed
                  - it: lastProposedAt should be the timestamp when the last block is proposed
      - when: propose one more block
        then:
          - when: it is still inside the last block's proving window
            then:
              - it: should revert if someone other than the proposer tries to prove the block
