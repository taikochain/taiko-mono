"""
This Python program generates a Solidity library file (data.sol) containing a function named `data()`.
The function returns a two-dimensional uint32 array with dimensions 2x100.

The array's elements are generated based on two different normal distributions for each sub-array [blockDelay, parentGasUsed]:

1. The first element 'blockDelay' is based on a mixed normal distribution with:
    - 95% of the values following a normal distribution centered around 3
    - 5% of the values following a normal distribution centered around 100

2. The second element 'parentGasUsed' follows a normal distribution centered around 4,300,000.

Each sub-array [blockDelay, parentGasUsed] is a sample, and there are 100 such samples in the array.

Note: Negative values for 'blockDelay' are avoided by taking the absolute value of the generated sample.

The generated Solidity library file (test/L2/1559/Lib1559MathTest.d.sol) contains the `data()` function, which initializes the two-dimensional array in memory and assigns each element individually based on the generated values.
