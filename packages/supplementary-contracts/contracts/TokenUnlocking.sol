///
/// It manages only unlocking and vested tokens will be deposited into this contract (through
/// 'depositToGrantee()' function) when the purchase notice sent out by Taiko, is paid. Unlocking
/// will be a 4-year immutable period, with a 1-year cliff, counting from TGE.
///
/// Vesting will be a regular (quarterly / twice a year, TBD) 'off-chain' legal payment action,
/// where those purschase notices can be exercised (still todo question: is it paid up-front or on
/// withdrawal?). Once tokens are deposited into this contract it cannot be forfeited anymore. If an
/// employment is ended, the company (Taiko) simply does not send out purchase notices anymore, so
/// that more tokens would not be deposited, beside the eligible proportion of that same vesting
/// release period (e.g.: if Bob spent 1 month at Taiko out of that quarterly/half-yearly vesting,
/// those will be deposited after purchased).
///
/// We should deploy multiple instances of this contract per grantee and per grant. So each person
/// should have the same amount of contract deployed as grants granted. (Due to different cost per
/// token / grant).
