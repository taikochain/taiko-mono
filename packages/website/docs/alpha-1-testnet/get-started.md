# Get started

Welcome to Taiko's Alpha-1 (a1) testnet! Thank you in advance for helping. We are going to guide you through this, let's go!

## Create a feedback log

[Create a feedback log](https://github.com/orgs/taikoxyz/discussions/new?category=feedback&title=Testnet%20feedback%20form&body=%23+Friction+log%0D%0A-+TODO%0D%0A%0D%0A%23+Other+notes%0D%0A-+TODO%0D%0A) in a separate tab. You can use this to write down any feedback while testing Taiko (eg. friction points, bugs, improvements).

Once you are finished testing the network, you can submit the feedback log and earn a GitPOAP!

## What is the testnet?

There are two networks involved in the testnet:

- A privately deployed Ethereum L1 (we'll refer to this as Taiko's private L1)
- Taiko

All of the relevant links can be found in this site's navigation. The relevant links are:

## Guided walkthrough

First of all, this testnet is yours to play with. Play with it, and help us learn together so we can improve it. We also have a guided walkthrough, which continues on from here.

Again, at the end of the walkthrough, you can submit your feedback log. Let's go!
