# Integration manual

This manual will help you to navigate a successful integration with Taiko. 

## RPC configuration

You can view the RPC configuration [here](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration). Taiko is an Ethereum-equivalent network (JSON-RPC API equivalent), meaning integrating with Taiko should be as simple as using our RPC instead of an Ethereum L1 RPC.

## Taiko brand assets

When using the Taiko logo, please use one of the branding icons/logos [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/tree/main/packages/branding).

## Add or update your project on our Ecosystem page

Click **Add or update your project** on our Ecosystem page [here](/ecosystem).

This will take you to a form where you can add/update details about your project. We will then handle the request and get it added to our page.

## Marketing

Generally, we don't really do "marketing". Our main goals are education and enabling builders. However, we are very happy to partner up on these things. One example is our Discord events, such as "Tea with Taiko", where we can go over some education topic or product walkthrough to further help enable our community. Keep in mind the main focus is not to promote visibility (for example, retweeting some integration), rather we like to focus on problems and how we can share learnings to the community.

## Additional support

If you have any questions or are in need of any support to integrate Taiko, please reach out. We understand there may be more complex scenarios or questions in your integration, so we are here to help.

You can message us / the community on Discord, and also contact a DevRel Engineer directly with the `@devrel` tag.
