The bridge is a set of smart contracts that allow you to send testnet ETH and ERC-20 tokens between Sepolia and Taiko. This bridge is just one possible implementation built on top of Taiko's core protocolâ€”you can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/concepts/bridging).

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on either Sepolia or Taiko (you can [request from faucet](/docs/guides/request-from-faucet))

## Steps

1. Visit the [bridge](https://bridge.a2.taiko.xyz/) and follow through the UI to bridge your tokens.
2. Transfer some ETH from Sepolia to Taiko
3. Receive some HORSE on Sepolia
4. Transfer some HORSE from Sepolia to Taiko
5. Receive some BLL on Sepolia
6. Transfer some BLL from Sepolia to Taiko
7. Transfer any tokens from Taiko to Sepolia

## Troubleshooting

### Why is my Taiko -> Sepolia transfer taking so long?

The transfer from Taiko to Sepolia can take a while because Taiko has a several hours delay in syncing block headers to allow uncle proof generation time, and we need the synced header to match so the Merkle proof of the message being sent on Taiko is valid on Sepolia.
