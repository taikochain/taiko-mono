  The BLL token should succeed when _minting_ from the faucet, and when _bridging_ it to Sepolia or Taiko. However, it will intentionally fail ~50% of the time when _claiming_ on Sepolia—this is so we can test the error handling.

The bridge is a set of smart contracts that allow you to send testnet ETH and ERC-20 tokens between Sepolia and Taiko. This bridge is just one possible implementation built on top of Taiko's core protocol—you can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/concepts/bridging).

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on either Sepolia or Taiko (you can [receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens))

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit the bridge
    Visit the [bridge](https://bridge.a2.taiko.xyz/) and the UI should be intuitive.

    ### Bridge tokens from Sepolia to Taiko
    Try bridging ETH, HORSE, and/or BLL from Sepolia to Taiko. You can also try manually claiming the transfer yourself by clicking the "Claim" button under the "Transactions" tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is my Taiko -> Sepolia transfer taking so long?

The transfer from Taiko to Sepolia can take a while because Taiko has a several hours delay in syncing block headers to allow uncle proof generation time, and we need the synced header to match so the Merkle proof of the message being sent on Taiko is valid on Sepolia.
