These steps will help you connect your wallet to the Taiko testnet. There are two networks to configure your wallet with: **Ethereum (Sepolia)** and **Taiko (Askja)**.

## Prerequisites

- Have a wallet installed and ready to use. Some examples are MetaMask and Frame. Please use a hot wallet (not a hardware wallet) for this guide, preferably a throwaway wallet.

## Steps

1. Add the Sepolia testnet by clicking "Add chain" at [https://chainlist.wtf/](https://chainlist.wtf).
2. Add the Taiko network by clicking the "Add chain" button (won't do anything if already added): <AddEthereumChainButton buttonText="Add Taiko chain" />

## Troubleshooting
### The add chain buttons did not work
Try to manually add the network to your wallet using the [RPC configuration](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration).
