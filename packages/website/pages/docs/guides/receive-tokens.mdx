## Prerequisites

- You have an Ethereum wallet address to accept the testnet tokens.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Receive Sepolia ETH
    Visit one of the faucets to receive ETH on Sepolia:
      - [sepolia-faucet.pk910.de](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de)
      - [faucet-sepolia.rockx.com](https://faucet-sepolia.rockx.com)
      - [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
      - [infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://infura.io/faucet/sepolia)
      - [faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)
      - [coinbase.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia-faucet](https://coinbase.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia-faucet)

    ### Receive BLL
    Repeat the previous step for receiving HORSE, except select "BLL" from the dropdown.

    ### Receive TTKO
    <Callout type="info">
    TTKO has been distributed to all proposers and provers from the alpha-1 and alpha-2 testnets. Check your address balance on Sepolia. Currently, the only other way to receive TTKO is by successfully generating proofs on alpha-3 testnet, for which the protocol rewards you in TTKO.
    </Callout>


    It's possible more will be distributed, especially considering those that did not run a proposer/prover in alpha1/alpha2, and those who are new to the Taiko community.

    Otherwise, you can obtain TTKO by successfully [proving blocks](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover) (the protocol rewards you in TTKO), from [Swap](https://swap.test.taiko.xyz), or by asking a community member on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/taikoxyz).
