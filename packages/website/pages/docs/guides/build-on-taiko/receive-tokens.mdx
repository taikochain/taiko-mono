# Receive tokens

This guide will help you receive testnet tokens. You can see all the deployed tokens [here](/docs/reference/contract-addresses).

## Prerequisites

- You have an Ethereum wallet address to accept the testnet tokens.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Receive Sepolia ETH
    You can receive Sepolia ETH from several online faucets. Here are a few you can try:
      - [sepolia-faucet.pk910.de](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de)
      - [faucet-sepolia.rockx.com](https://faucet-sepolia.rockx.com)
      - [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com)

    ### Receive HORSE
    Navigate to the [bridge](https://bridge.test.taiko.xyz), select HORSE from the dropdown, and click "Faucet".

    ### Receive BLL
    Repeat the previous step for receiving HORSE, except select "BLL" from the dropdown.

    ### Receive TTKOj

    TTKOj has been distributed to all proposers and provers from the alpha-1 and alpha-2 testnets and you can see those transactions [here](TODO(docs)). You can see the script used [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/operations).

    Otherwise, you can obtain TTKOj by successfully [proposing blocks](/docs/guides/enable-a-proposer) (the protocol rewards you in TTKOj) or from [Swap](https://swap.test.taiko.xyz).
