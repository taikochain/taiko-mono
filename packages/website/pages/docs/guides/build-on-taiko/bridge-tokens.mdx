# Bridge tokens

<Callout type="warning">
  The BLL token is **expected to fail** about 50% of the time when
  bridging--this is done intentionally to test error handling.
</Callout>

## Overview

This guide will help you use the bridge to send tokens between Sepolia and Taiko. You can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/concepts/bridging).

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Sepolia or Taiko (you can [receive tokens here](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit a bridge
    Visit the bridge [here](https://bridge.test.taiko.xyz/).

    ### Bridge tokens
    Try bridging tokens between networks by selecting them from the dropdown. You can also manually claim the transfer yourself by clicking the "Claim" button under the "Transactions" tab (but **only** if you already have some ETH on the destination chain).
