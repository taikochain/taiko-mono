# Enable a prover

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a prover. Read more about prover dynamics [here](/docs/concepts/proving#prover-dynamics).

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node))
- Must have some ETH on Sepolia (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM. (**note: see warning above**)

## Steps

<Steps>
### Open `.env` file in `simple-taiko-node`
Open the `.env` file in the `simple-taiko-node` directory.

### Set environment variables to enable prover

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover:

- Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true` (replacing the default `false` with `true`).
- Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to that of your wallet's private key; it will need some ETH on Sepolia to prove blocks (if using MetaMask, follow these directions to [retrieve the private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key)).

### Verify prover logs

Verify you have some prover logs:

- `ðŸ’° Your block proof was accepted` means you are the first prover and receive the reward.
- `âœ… Valid block proven` just means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).

If you are running a node in the background, you can view the logs with `docker compose logs -f`.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Consult [Run a node - Troubleshooting](/docs/guides/run-a-node#troubleshooting) for common issues.
