  Keep in mind that running a prover is a very competitive space, and those who

# Enable a prover

This guide will help you enable your Taiko node as a prover. Read more about prover dynamics [here](/docs/concepts/proving#prover-dynamics) (especially to set your expectations about running a prover).

## Prerequisites

- You have already setup a node (see: [Run a node](/docs/guides/run-a-node))
- Must have some ETH on Sepolia (see: [Receive tokens](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Open `.env` file in `simple-taiko-node`
Open the `.env` file in the `simple-taiko-node` directory.

### Set environment variables to enable prover

<Callout type="warning">
  Do **not** use a private key that is valuable to you. The private key will be
  stored in plain text in the `.env` file, and this is not secure. There is a
  real risk of losing your assets. You should **only use a test account**.
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables to enable your node as a prover:

- Set `ENABLE_PROVER` to `true` (replacing the default `false` with `true`).
- Set `L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to that of your wallet's private key; it will need some ETH on Sepolia to prove blocks (if using MetaMask, follow these directions to [retrieve the private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key)).

### Stake your TTKOe (Eldfell L3 provers only)

If you are trying to run a prover for Eldfell L3 first keep in mind, the competition for getting into the prover pool will be high. But don't worry! Even if you get slashed, there's nothing wrong with that. TTKOe is a worthless testnet token, and even getting slashed really helps us to test the network.

To stake your TTKOe try using the [staking dashboard](https://staking.l3test.taiko.xyz/) or the base layer contract manually (see [TaikoL1](/docs/reference/contract-addresses)).

### Changing the Staked TTKOe Amount (Only for Eldfell L3 Provers)

In the event that you have staked TTKOe and made an error in the amount, you can change the staked amount at any time [here](https://explorer.test.taiko.xyz/address/0xC9580414A4372BDdBd8e19e01854DC0B2b1390Cf/write-proxy#address-tabs).
However, there are some considerations.
For example, if you've staked 2 TTKOe and want to change the staked amount to 1 TTKOe, the difference of 1 TTKOe will be exited and you will not be able to withdraw it for a week. Be careful when entering the amount.

<Callout type="warning">
  Always manually add eight zeros for the decimal '10^8`.
</Callout>

Enter an arbitrary number below. Unlike the UI's Amount per Capacity, the entered amount will be directly reflected.

8. stake â†’
amount
rewardPerGas (uint32)
maxCapacity (uint32) (minimum:32)

In the example above, if you enter 1 in the amount and click Write, the amount will change from 2 to 1, and 1 TTKOe will be exited.

### Verify prover logs

Verify you have some prover logs:

- `ðŸ’° Your block proof was accepted` means you are the first prover and receive the reward.
- `âœ… Block proven` just means a proposed block was successfully proved on TaikoL1 (by anyone).

If you are running a node in the background, you can view the logs with `docker compose logs -f`.

</Steps>

Consult [Run a node - Troubleshooting](/docs/guides/run-a-node#troubleshooting) for common issues.
